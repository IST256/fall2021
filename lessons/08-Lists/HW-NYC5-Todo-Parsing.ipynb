    "# Now You Code 5: The TODO List\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we write a simple TODO list program in Python. The user interface for out TODO list app will be a basic text parser. So for example if you want to add an item to your TODO list called `clean my room`, you would type: `add todo clean my room`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of the commands understood by our parser:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `add todo-item` add an item to the TODO list.\n",
    "- `del todo-item` removes an item from the TODO list. \n",
    "- `show` shows items on the TODO list\n",
    "- `quit` exits the program loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "One again, we will apply problem simplification and work on this problem in 3 parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Part 1 we will create the command parser loop first.\n",
    "2. In Part 2 we code the `add`, `del` and `show` commands.\n"

Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n",
